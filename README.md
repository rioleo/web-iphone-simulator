Web iPhone Simulator
=============

This is a quick and simple web-based iPhone simulator that you can use to redirect your users if they visit your mobile web app on a desktop browser.

Usage Instructions
add the iphone.php script along with iphone.jpg and black.jpg images into a folder on your web server.

access using mysite.com/iphone.php?url=example.com/mymobilesite

This will load example.com/mymobilesite into the iphone iframe.

Need update on how to utilise the multiple phone feature.
